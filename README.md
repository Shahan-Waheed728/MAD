This repository contains lab tasks for the Mobile Application Development course, implemented in JavaScript. Each task applies different programming concepts such as functions, parameters, and object manipulation.
Lab Task 1 – Functions with Parameters

Implemented four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

Each function demonstrates different JavaScript parameter techniques:

add() → checks for undefined arguments

subtract() → uses ES6 default parameters

multiply() → uses rest parameters

divide() → uses the arguments object

Lab Task 2 – Generic Method with Object Operations

Implemented a generic function solveThis() which takes an object with keys like sum, max, and min.

Performs operations dynamically and returns an object with results.

Demonstrates usage of:

reduce() for sum, min, and max

Dynamic object creation with computed keys
